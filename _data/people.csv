During her time at the University, she found her passion majoring in Sociology. She is thankful to the staff and faculty at the Sociology and Anthropology Department, especially Dr. Leontina Hormel and Dr. Kristin Haltinner, for the research opportunities she was able to be a part of. The Syringa Mobile Home research led by Dr. Leontina Hormel has greatly shaped Ballesterosâ€™ understanding of low income housing, governmental, social and economic structure of mobile home parks. She hopes to pursue board membership on commissions dedicated to bettering the housing crisis in the greater Dallas area in the near future. Cynthia has moved to Dallas, Texas where she spends time with her fiance and puppy. She is excited to continue her business venture and her studies.",cynthia,n,003
